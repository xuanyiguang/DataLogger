column 3: reading along the x-axis from SensorEvent.values[0] (in either m/s^2 or uT)
column 4: reading along the y-axis from SensorEvent.values[1] (in either m/s^2 or uT)
column 5: reading along the z-axis from SensorEvent.values[2] (in either m/s^2 or uT)
column 6: accuracy from SensorEvent.accuracy

The format for Loc is as follows:
column 1: timestamp (in Unix time in milliseconds) from Location.getTime();
column 2: timestamp (in Unix time in milliseconds) from System.currentTimeMillis();
column 3: provider (1 for gps, or 2 for network)
